# Keyword Lists Preparation

## Step 1: Find a list of insider terms used by extremists
We are unable to upload this list, but these types of lists can be found online, at sites such as [this one](https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2017/10/8/a-brief-dictionary-to-help-understand-the-us-far-right).

Once you have this list, save it as `insider_terms.txt` in the `keywords_lists` directory. Include one term per line, without commas or other punctuation.

## Step 2 Find a list of bad (swear) words
Again, we are unable to upload this list, but these kinds of terms are commonly available at other sources such as [this one](https://github.com/zacanger/profane-words). 

Once you have this list, save it as `profanity_list.txt` in the `keywords_lists` directory. Include one term per line, without commas or other punctuation. 

Alternatively, we can provide these lists via email upon request.
