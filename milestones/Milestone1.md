## Proposal

Write 100-200 words explaining the classification question that your team wants to answer using machine learning models.

Our question is a binary classification problem determining if a tweet (or twitter account) is political propaganda. We plan to either pull from existing labeled datasets which label propaganda techniques by various state propaganda sources, or to create our own dataset by scraping and analyzing twitter accounts and using a propaganda labeling model to produce our training data set. Based on established research on propaganda techniques, we plan to train our model on features that could correspond with different text-based propaganda techniques, including fear-based language, name calling, repetition, excessive use of capitalization and punctuation, and flag-waving. Early candidates for data sources include a [human-annotated dataset of 20,000 tweets related to Russia, China, and India](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14931), as well as a [dataset of tweets related to the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill protests in India from 2019 to 2021](https://data.niaid.nih.gov/resources?id=zenodo_7797034). 

Propaganda can be defined as the dissemination of information–facts, arguments, rumors, half-truths, or lies–to influence public opinion. Having tools that can identify propaganda techniques within social media posts is highly important in a world where individuals are consuming large amounts of media every single day. When users are unable to identify propaganda within their own feeds, misinformation and manipulative narratives spread more easily, which can threaten the safety and freedoms of groups targeted by these techniques.
